# Identicons

*Identicons* are images that are generated from a seed value in a
consistent but unpredictable way. This is usually accomplished by
seeding a random number generator, and then getting values from it in
a consistent way.

Identicons are useful for automatically assigning images to items in a
CRUD interface, giving new users a thematic avatar, or any other place
where having distinguishable icons is useful, but choosing them by
hand would be too tedious.
